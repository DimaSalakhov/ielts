Q:
A great many countries around the world are losing their cultural identity because of the
Internet.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

A:

The bigger variety of global mass media humanity has, the bigger damage to cultural identity it causes. 
Newspapers, magazines, radio, movies, television, they all played its roles in cultures' blurring, but so far the Internet,
as channel of data delivery, impacts in the most severe way on cultures of all involved countries.

And the reason why am I saying that is the level of penetration of each information resource into everyday life of youngsters.
The Internet quickly became a land of teenagers, and any child nowadays spend more time in the world wide web there t
han an adult. And I'm paying most of my attention in this question to teenagers for a reason,
because it's they who will present nation with it's cultural values in 20 years, and if they lose their endemic language, food,
songs or traditions then most likely we, as a global society, will lose these unique pieces of culture forever.

You may ask why I'm so negative to the time which our children spend in the Internet, and my answer will be short and simple - 
Facebook. Teenagers spend most of their time not on self education, but on chatting and watching video clips on Facebook or 
similar social networks. Of course, these networks aggregate information from all over the world, but dominant majority of it 
comes from the Western culture. Sprawling over the Internet, these bits of Western culture, and unfortunately to a greater 
extent these are not the best ones, often take root in teenagers substituting their culture identity.

Looking on the last ten years, I have a strong personal opinion that current state of usage of the Internet has negative 
influence on cultural diversity of the global society.
